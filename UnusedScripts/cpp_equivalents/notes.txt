multithreading in sim_repeat refuses to comply - threads end up calling 
the same functions (most likely)
others are similar in speed - not worth the compile time or precompile effort

Maybe there is potential there if we had a void function that could 
modify dfs by reference (pass function object to thread) 
but that's probably not gonna fly with rcpp and I don't know what will happen
to embedded functions.
